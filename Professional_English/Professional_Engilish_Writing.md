## Text 1: Creativity or Tradition

Creativity and Tradition is a pair of the forever topic no matter in which age. A great philosopher, Karl Marx said that there is opposite and unified in this objective world.

In chinese culture, Tradition means that somebody keep themself when they are facing some special condition and great change. No matter what, it is look like conservatism and spread a historitic sense to others.

The concept of Tradition tells us don't doubt anything which has been proved long long ago, unless it is really ridiculous just like the Sima Guang’s story of saving people in ancient china.

Creativity is a key word from froeign but chinese traditional vocabulary. In Socialism theory with Chinese characteristics, Deng Xiaoping, a great leader and politician, who is a said that: "Innovation is the primary productivity".

Menderlee, a great chemist, who discoverd the regulation of periodic table of the element, as the result of being good at make conclusion in every experiment and fails. Tomas Editon, in order to bring people into a new world that no dark, he finded out a kind of partical material to make buld after he try 1000 times in experiment. Andrew Carnegie, a famous entrepreneur, who has been called Stell King, he is also a philanthropist help many people all over the world.

In my opinion, as a young people, we must keep creativity and be crazy at working for recieving good life we want. I believe we can create our great tomorrow. Just do it!

## Text 2: Liberty or Discipline

Academically, liberty is a key word, which mean that humans can hold themselves and take action in their mind without receiving others permission. In the region of Politics, it includes  and involve some concept for example Rights and Obligation.

The Declaration of Human Rights, 1789, "Liberty has the right to do everything that is harmless to others." In a democratic society ruled by law, nobody can capture the liberty rights of others unless this guy wanna break the low.

As we all know, Statue of Liberty, a giant neoclassical statue on Freedom Island, New York Harbor, New York, USA. It symbolizes human rights freedom, freedom of trade and freedom of speech in the United States.

Discipline, a concept which opposite to liberty, means that there are some rules or limits within a certain scope. In China, people it is forbidden to publish and disseminate some news and remarks that are unfavourable to the government image. This state is unbelievable in western countries even being blamed for not being free speech.

The Qing Dynasty’s closed-door policy has made China’s development stagnant. In order to learn lessons, Deng Xiaoping's theory of reform and opening up made China's economy take off rapidly and bring chinese to a mordenization country.

In my opinion, I believe liberty which will bring people to a open and nice world prefer to discipline.
